The player will act as a travelling jellyfish and visit a town with a forbidden dungeon.

He will meet with the lives there and try to solve the mystery of the dungeon and the world.

The player will encounter many difficulties and enemies there.
The only way to solve the problems is to learn Japanese.

A Gojuon(五十音) Table and a dictionary system is implemented to support the player. New vocabs associated with the story and the conversations will be automatically added into the dictionary. The player can refer to the pronunciation anytime.

Have you ever played any RPG?I was tolerated by many old RPG when I was a child because there were only Japanese version.
I couldn't understand the contents in the game well but deeply attracted by them and tried to clear them. That's the charm of game.
If a game could help people to learn a language, how wonderful would it be? This is the intention for me to make this game.
